# Checkout Test Submission 
Running the `Main` class in an IDE will launch a CMD line app that will ask for product codes. These can be entered as integers (so '1' instead of '001).
To stop product entry, just type 'exit' and the application will print the final amount.

The test class 'AcceptanceTest.java' encodes the required data and passes as required.

NOTE: `gradle run` from a cmd line will launch the App as well BUT in Macos the `scanner` is not properly detecting input but it may work in another OS
